# Tutorial: Use Telepresence to develop and test microservices locally

[Telepresence] is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox project created by the team at Ambassador Labs. Telepresence allows developers to run services locally on their development machine while connected to a remote Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This setup makes it easier to develop, debug, and test applications that interact with other services in the cluster without having to redeploy or rebuild the entire application in Kubernetes every time changes are made.

> [!NOTE]
> Telepresence is an open-source CNCF project. Microsoft doesn't offer support for problems you might have using Telepresence. If you do have problems using Telepresence, visit their [Telepresence GitHub issue page] and open an issue.

In this tutorial, you connect an AKS cluster to Telepresence and then modify a sample application running locally.

## How Telepresence works

Telepresence injects Traffic Agents into the workload pod as a sidecar. The Traffic Agents act as a proxy, rerouting inbound and outbound network traffic from the AKS cluster to your local machine. Then, you can develop and test in your local environment as though your local machine were in the AKS cluster. The process involves:

- Connecting to your AKS cluster to Telepresence.
- Specifying the service or deployment you want to intercept inbound and outbound traffic for and then reroute to your local environment.
- Running the local version of the service. Telepresence connects the local version of the service to the cluster through the proxy pod.


# Using Telepresence with a sample app running on an AKS cluster

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster you can use for this tutorial, create one using [Tutorial - Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](./tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster.md).
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is installed and on the path in command-line environment you use for development. This tutorial uses `kubectl` to manage the Kubernetes cluster. `kubectl` is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell. To install `kubectl` locally, use the [`az aks install-cli`](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_install_cli) command. 
- An application to deploy. In this tutorial we will be using the [aks-store-demo app].
- [Telepresence] installed


## Connect to the cluster

> [!NOTE]
> Set the values of $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME and $MY_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME accordingly.

Before you can install Telepresence and interact with your AKS cluster, make sure you're connected to your cluster. If you didn't install `kubectl` in the _Prerequisites_ section, do that before continuing.

1. Configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $MY_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

1. Verify the connection to your cluster using the [kubectl cluster-info][kubectl cluster-info] command. This command will print out the name of the cluster to help you identity if it is the correct cluster to be working with.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

## Clone the sample app and deploy it your AKS cluster

The [aks-store-demo app] used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-service-kubernetes-tutorials/aks-store-architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Store sample architecture." lightbox="./media/container-service-kubernetes-tutorials/aks-store-architecture.png":::

* **Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.
* **Product service**: Shows product information.
* **Order service**: Places orders.
* **Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

### [Git](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Use [git] to clone the sample application to your development environment.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git
    ```

2. Change into the cloned directory.

    ```console
    cd aks-store-demo
    ```

To deploy the app, run the following command

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml
    ```

## Install Telepresence

### Install the Telepresence Client

Telepresence can be installed on [GNU/Linux], [Mac], or [Windows]. Click your corresponding OS to visit the Telepresence documentation for installation instructions.

### Install the Telepresence traffic manager

To route cloud traffic to your local machine, Telepresence uses a traffic manager. Helm is used to deploy the traffic manager into your Kubernetes cluster.

    ```console
    telepresence helm install
    ```


### Intercept your services

To start using Telepresence in your AKS cluster, run the `telepresence connect` command.

    ```console
    telepresence connect
    ```

`telepresence connect` connects to your AKS cluster and connects to the Kubernetes API server. After running `telepresence connect` similar output should appear

    ```console
    Connected to context myAKSCluster, namespace default (https://myAKSCluster-dns-ck7w5t5h.hcp.eastus2.azmk8s.io:443)
    ```

Using the `telepresence list` command, you will be able to see all the services that can be interecepted.

    ```console
    telepresence list
    order-service  : ready to intercept (traffic-agent not yet installed)
    product-service: ready to intercept (traffic-agent not yet installed)
    rabbitmq       : ready to intercept (traffic-agent not yet installed)
    store-front    : ready to intercept (traffic-agent not yet installed)
    ```

To start intercepting traffic from a service in your AKS cluster, you first need to find the correct port. Running the `kubectl get service service-name --output yaml` command will help find you the port.

In the following example, we will run the command on the `store-front` service to find the appropriate port (port 80) to use in our intercepts.

    ```console
     kubectl get service store-front -ojsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].port}'
    ```

To properly intercept traffic from your service in your AKS cluster, run the following command `$ telepresence intercept <service-name> --port <local-port>[:<remote-port>] --env-file <path-to-env-file>`.

The port field must have the local port and the remote-port, which is the port used in your AKS cluster.

The env-file field is the path where Telepresence will create an env file containing the appropriate environment variables needed to intercept traffic. This is **needed** to properly intercept your service's traffic to your local machine. If a file doesn't exist, telepresence will create it for you.

> [!NOTE]
> `sshfs` is required in order for volume mounts to work correctly during intercepts for both linux and macos versions of Telepresence. If you don't have it installed, view the official [documentation](https://www.telepresence.io/docs/troubleshooting#volume-mounts-are-not-working-on-macos) for more information.


    ```console
    cd src/store-front
    telepresence intercept store-front --port 8080:80 --env-file .env
   Using Deployment store-front
   Intercept name         : store-front
   State                  : ACTIVE
   Workload kind          : Deployment
   Destination            : 127.0.0.1:8080
   Service Port Identifier: 80/TCP
   Volume Mount Point     : /tmp/telfs-3392425241
   Intercepting           : all TCP connections
    ```

### Modify Your Local Code and See Real-Time Changes

Now that Telepresence is set up, you can start modifying your local code. These changes will be reflected in real-time, allowing you to test and debug directly against your AKS cluster.

In `components/TopNav.Vue` change the `Products` nav item to `New Products`.

```console
<template>
  <nav>
    <div class="logo">
      <a href="/">
        <img src="/contoso-pet-store-logo.png" alt="Contoso Pet Store Logo">
      </a>
    </div>
    <button class="hamburger" @click="toggleNav">
      <span class="hamburger-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <ul class="nav-links" :class="{ 'nav-links--open': isNavOpen }">
      <li><router-link to="/" @click="closeNav">New Products</router-link></li>
      <li><router-link to="/cart" @click="closeNav">Cart ({{ cartItemCount }})</router-link></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</template>
```

Afer saving these changes, run the following commans to get the app running locally.

```console
npm install
npm run serve
```

Now, if you visit the public IP of the `store-front` service in your AKS cluster, youâ€™ll see the updated behavior, as traffic is being routed to your locally running version of the service. Your local changes are reflected in real-time and interact with other services in your AKS cluster.
